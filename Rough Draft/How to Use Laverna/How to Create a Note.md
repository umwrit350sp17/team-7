It is also a good idea to assign the note to a notebook. This is a good idea when you are taking notes for different classes. You can seperate subjects or chapters to easily be able to find where your notes are stored. For an example I have created a notebook with the name of "Sample 1" to give an example of the notebooks that would appear on the list. Once you create your own notebooks you will see them all listed in the dropdown box below:

After you have assigned your note a title and assigned the note to a notebook, you will need to type content. This content will be typed into the left white box on the screen, right below the "Title" box.
