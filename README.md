# team-7

Team 7 researched an open source program known as Laverna. Laverna is a great tool for college students to use as a cloud storage for notes. The program conveniently connects to DropBox to allow students to access notes anywhere where there is access to internet. Within Laverna, one can create notes within notebooks, which is great for students to seperate subjects. Laverna is a free program that college students should explore. Need help, find instructions within team 7 repository!
