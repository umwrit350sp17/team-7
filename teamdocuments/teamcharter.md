**Broad Team Goals:**
- To accuratley display our opensource platform
- We hope to collaboratively work together.
- Grow our knowledge in new technological platforms.

**Measurable Team Goals:**
- We strive to turn in all assignments on time.
- Stay on top of the work, not letting assignments drift behind.
- Learn more about differnet codes with Github

**Personal Goals:**
- David: I hope to learn and get and gain new experience with technological platforms.  I hope to improve my abilities with github and other resources that we will be using over this project.
- Evelyn: I hope to learn more about the new platform I will be working with. I also hope to learn how to better collaborate tiwth a team through technological means. I also hope to learn more about what we plan to do our project on and how it can benefit me as a student. 
- Sarah: I hope to gain new expierence with Github and other technological platforms. I also hope to learn about the source we do out project on and learn to use it for my feature college career. 

**Individual Commitment:**
- David:  I will commit to working my hardest and doing my best in everything I do.  I out of town most weekends.  I have no classes on Tuesday or Thursday.  I can be free most nights during the week.  Tuesday nights is the only night where I am busy all night.
- Evelyn: I will commit my time that I am not in classes to focusing on the project. I am open usually on the weekends and most week nights. I will meet all deadlines and put a lot of effort into my work. 
- Sarah: I am the team captain, and I will commit to anything as long as the work is evenly distributed. I am out of town most weekends, but still have access to my computer. So, if a meeting is ever needed I would usually on be available Monday-Thursday.

**Other Concerns:**
- Everyone has really busy schedules, so it might be hard to be on the same pace throughout the week.
- Letting the project creep up on us, and not completing assignments on time.

**Conflict Resolution:**
- In the case of a conflict, all group members will communicate with each other.
- Get work done sooner rather than later in the week incase a problem arises there will be time to resolve it.

**Missed Deadlines:**
- If someone misses a deadline, that will be mentioned in the progress report.
- We consider communication a deadline, so if we are not able to communicate that is a deadline and will also be mentioned in the progress report.
- If somone thinks they will not be able to make a deadline, other team members must be notified immediately so the other members can try to pick up the slack.

**Unacceptable Work:**
- We hope to not cross this issue, so we plan to look over group member's work before submission and edit as needed.
- If it is encountered, other team members will have a conversation with the person who submitted unacceptable work and work to resolve the issue so it does not happen in the future.
