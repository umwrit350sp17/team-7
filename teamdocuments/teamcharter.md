**Broad Team Goals:**

- We hope to collaboratively work together.
- Grow our knowledge in new technological platforms.

**Measurable Team Goals:**

**Personal Goals:**
- David:
- Evelyn:
- Sarah: I hope to gain new expierence with Github and other technological platforms. I also hope to learn about the source we do out project on and learn to use it for my feature college career. 

**Individual Commitment:**
- David:
- Evelyn:
- Sarah: I am the team captain, and I will commit to anything as long as the work is evenly distributed. I am out of town most weekends, but still have access to my computer. So, if a meeting is ever needed I would usually on be available Monday-Thursday.

**Other Concerns:**
- Everyone has really busy schedules, so it might be hard to be on the same pace throughout the week.
- Letting the project creep up on us, and not completing assignments on time.

**Conflict Resolution:**
- In the case of a conflict, all group members will communicate with each other.
- Get work done sooner rather than later in the week incase a problem arises there will be time to resolve it.

**Missed Deadlines:**
- If someone misses a deadline, that will be mentioned in the progress report.
- We consider communication a deadline, so if we are not able to communicate that is a deadline and will also be mentioned in the progress report.
- If somone thinks they will not be able to make a deadline, other team members must be notified immediately so the other members can try to pick up the slack.

**Unacceptable Work:**
- We hope to not cross this issue, so we plan to look over group member's work before submission and edit as needed.
- If it is encountered, other team members will have a conversation with the person who submitted unacceptable work and work to resolve the issue so it does not happen in the future.
