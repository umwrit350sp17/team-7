Team 7 Progress Report
Date Submitted: March 5, 2017


Team Accomplishments:

We decided on a topic for our project, using a cloud application as a way to transport files.
We set up Github, made the team folder, learned more about the application and how to use it.
We originally communicated in Slack, but decided GroupMe would be a better form of communication as we always receive notifications
Created our team charter and this weeks progress report.
Assigned positions to each group member:

Unfinished Tasks:

We still need to decide exactly which file sharing application we are going to do our project on.

Schedule Revisions:
We will communicate through GroupMe as needed, and we are on task.

Group Problems:

We are a little confused about the project. This will take some time getting used too, but we will be able to help each other and ask questions as needed. Also with time we will gain confidence in using programs such as Github.

Late Status Reports:

All team members were communciated with.
