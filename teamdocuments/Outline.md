##**Audience Profile:**##

John Doe, an entering college freshman has never had to take notes in a college enviroment. In high school notes were either given to students or notes were formed in an outline format. This left John Doe worried an dunprepared to have to take notes for himself in a college setting. 

John Doe realized that taking notes in college would be very important. but, without a printer in his dorm room how would he print his notes in the computer lab? John Doe had many differnt options such as email or a flash drive, but neither of those were very reliable. He thought he might lose a flash drive, and an email would not always contain the most current version of his document. 

John Doe decided that the best way to keep track of his notes, and have them avalible anywhere would be to use a cloud document program. John Doe and many other college students are always on the go, and often cannot take a computer everywhere. Cloud sharing programs allow for students to have documents at the tip of their fingertips, as most students have smart phones.

A program such as Laverna, has a smartphone app and can be accessed online, and synched through programs such as DropBox. This allows for college students to access documents in their dorm rooms, computer labs, and even as they are riding the bus to class. The program allows for students to create different notebooks. So, different class notes can be divided, and students can remain organized even on the web. Laverna allows John Doe and all other college students access to their notes anywhere at anytime, while staying organized.
