# **Team 7: Document Outline**

**This file contains the analysis of the audience for the document as well as the general outline of the project.**

## **Audience Profile:**

John Doe, an entering college freshman has never had to take notes in a college enviroment. In high school notes were either given to students or notes were formed in an outline format. This left John Doe worried an dunprepared to have to take notes for himself in a college setting. 

John Doe realized that taking notes in college would be very important. but, without a printer in his dorm room how would he print his notes in the computer lab? John Doe had many differnt options such as email or a flash drive, but neither of those were very reliable. He thought he might lose a flash drive, and an email would not always contain the most current version of his document. 

John Doe decided that the best way to keep track of his notes, and have them avalible anywhere would be to use a cloud document program. John Doe and many other college students are always on the go, and often cannot take a computer everywhere. Cloud sharing programs allow for students to have documents at the tip of their fingertips, as most students have smart phones.

A program such as Laverna, has a smartphone app and can be accessed online, and synched through programs such as DropBox. This allows for college students to access documents in their dorm rooms, computer labs, and even as they are riding the bus to class. The program allows for students to create different notebooks. So, different class notes can be divided, and students can remain organized even on the web. Laverna allows John Doe and all other college students access to their notes anywhere at anytime, while staying organized. 

## **Project Outline:**

Project: How to use Laverna as a college student

#### **Introduction**
- our team has decided that we will organize out steps within multiple folders instead of one large folder
- we belive this will be the easiest way for users to find directions
- we will be using screen shots from the Laverna web page in order to better depict our instructions
- We will not be using any external information, besides possibly infromation from DropBox on how to set up an account, otherwise all information will come from Laverna

### **Topics to Discuss Within Instructions**
              (Possible Folders)
- Introduction to the Laverna Program
- How to Download Laverna
- How to Set up a DropBox account
- How to Create a Notebook
- How to access a Notebook
- How to access all Notes
- How to edit existing text
- How to format text
- How to Access Settings and what can be found within settings
- How to add encryption

- As of right now, this is an order in which we think that the folders would flow nicely. When many people set up it instructs you about encryption, so instructions are really only needed if one decided to add encryption at a later time. In the begining the program is very self explainatory but once the account is set up is one one might need some more detailed instruction
- To demonsrate how to use this program, one person within our group will create an account and screenshot differnt parts of the instructions. 
- Our very first folder will include an introductino to the program, including screen shots of the program home page so users will know they are at the right site

### ** Conclusion**

Laverna is a tool that many will be able to find useful when transporting notes around campus and outside of campus as a college student. As the instructions will show it is very striaght forward and easy to use. This program can be used on many differnt operating systems which makes it very easy for a wide range of college students to use.
